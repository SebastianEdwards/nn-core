20130220 / 0.1.6
	* Several fixes for tcp string handling have made it to nanomsg trunk,
		so I can now re-enable those specs.
		
	*	For MRI Ruby, add @blocking=true before all function attachments to instruct
		the FFI gem to release the GIL.
		
	*	Fixed a nn_recv spec to only read a specific number of bytes from a received
		string. Must note that the library does not null terminate strings on its
		own so we need to be very careful how many bytes are read from received
		strings.
		

20130215 / 0.1.5
	*	libnanomsg has removed the nn_init and nn_term functions. Updated
		specs to remove those features.
		
	*	Added NN_BUS protocol.


20130204 / 0.1.0
	* Initial release. Wrapped the nanomsg library as of commit 
		5ded934af0.
